## Abstract

[Cline Center for Democracy](http://www.clinecenter.illinois.edu/) uses data science to predict when and where social conflicts will happen by gathering news articles around the world and analyze them. However, some of articles are protected under copyright law. So the Cline Center can only distribute their metadata such as n-grams. The purpose of this project is to determine what is the highest possible value for n in n-grams under the condition that people cannot reconstruct the orignical document based on the n-grams data (so we won't violate the copyright).
